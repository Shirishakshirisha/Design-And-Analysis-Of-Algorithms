Sliding Window- Sliding Window Technique is a method used to efficiently solve problems that involve 
defining a window or range in the input data [list/strings] and then moving that window across the data 
to perform some operation within the window.

How to Identify Sliding Window — The basic idea behind the sliding window technique is to transform two nested
 loops into a single loop.

 Below are some fundamental clues to identify sliding window algorithm problems:

    The problem will be based on an array, list or string type of data structure.
    It will ask to find subranges in that array to give the longest, shortest or target values of a string.
    Its concept is mainly based on ideas like the longest sequence or shortest sequence of something that 
satisfies a given condition perfectly.



    Using the Sliding Window Technique:

The Sliding Window Technique is a powerful approach to efficiently solve problems involving arrays, strings, 
or sequences by maintaining a moving “window” of elements and performing operations as the window slides
 through the data. This technique helps reduce time complexity compared to brute-force methods.

    Determine Window Size: Decide on a fixed window size that defines the number of elements to consider at each step.
    Initialize and Process: Start with the initial elements within the window. Perform any initial calculations or operations.
    Slide the Window: Iterate through the data, updating the window by adding the next element and removing the leftmost one.
    Update and Evaluate: Adjust calculations or data structures based on the new element. Evaluate if the current window meets 
  the problem’s conditions.
    Continue Sliding: Repeat the sliding, updating, and evaluation steps until the end of the data is reached.
    Return Result: Return the final result or outcome based on the processed windows.



    Time and Space complexity of the sliding window technique:

    Time Complexity: The time complexity of the sliding window technique is usually linear or close to linear, O(n), where n is the 
size of the input data structure (e.g., array or string). This is because you process each element once as the window slides through the data.

    Space Complexity: The space complexity of the sliding window technique is generally constant, O(1),
 because you’re maintaining a fixed-size window and a few additional variables to perform calculations or store intermediate results. 
The amount of extra memory used doesn’t grow with the input size; it remains constant regardless of the input size.


Applications 
Data transfer
Computer networks
 It is utilized for flow control in the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). In addition, this method may be used to construct a variety of competitive issues.

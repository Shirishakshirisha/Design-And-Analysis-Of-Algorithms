Types of trees
1. Full Binary Tree (0 or 2 children)
2. Complete Binary tree(All levels shoul be completely filled except the last level and also last level should fil fron left)
3. Perfect Binary Tree (All leaf node are at the same level)
4. Balanced Binary Tree (Height can be a maximum of log(n) where n = nodes (+-1(the height difference)))
5. Degenerate Tree (Skew Binary Tree)

Traversal
2 Types

1. BFS
2. DFS

INORDER TRAVERSAL(left root right)(go to extreme left of subtree and then go to right extreme right subtree)
Preorder Traversal(root left right)(print root first then left then rigth)
Postprder traversal(left right root)
